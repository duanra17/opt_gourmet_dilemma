# opt_gourmet_dilemma
Mini-project for my optimization course: the Gourmet's dilemma (linear programming) using the Pyomo library.

For many people, going to a buffet is more than a mere meal; it is an unconscious
optimization problem, where they try to consume as much of their most enjoyed food as
possible while making the entrance price worthwhile. For this reason, we choose to formalize
this behavior as a linear programming optimization problem.

For this project, we:
* defined the model (decision variables, constraints, objective function)
* implemented using the Conda environment, using the Pyomo library for the code and using the IPOPT solver
* applied it to a fictitious study case
* analyzed the results
